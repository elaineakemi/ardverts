  ➜  Network: https://192.168.0.xx:xxxx/
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

### Considerations
This prototype was created for an academic assignment so it does not follow all the best-practices and also not production ready.

This was tested mostly on mobile devices using Android. No tests done in IOS and it probably doesn't work as expected due hardware restrictions that would need to be addressed separated in the code.

##### Devices tested:
- Pixel 3a
- Pixel 4a
